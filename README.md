Data-Analysis-Assignment - Netflix shows - MySQL

Dataset Name: Netflix Shows

Difficulties Encountered
Table Name Issue: After importing the dataset, the table was incorrectly named with parentheses (`netflix_titles (1)`). This caused syntax errors during querying. To resolve this, I renamed the table using the following command:
  RENAME TABLE `netflix_titles (1)` TO `netflix_titles`;

Interesting Observation
One interesting thing I noticed about the Netflix Shows dataset is the significant prevalence of certain genres. Comedy and Drama are among the most common genres, suggesting that these types of content are highly favored by Netflix's audience.
